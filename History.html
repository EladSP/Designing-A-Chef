  Origin

    <p>
    Ramen is a Japanese adaptation of Chinese wheat noodles. Ramen was first introduced to Japan by Chinese immigrants in the late 19th or early 20th century. According to the record of the new <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin-Yokohama_Rāmen_Museum"><strong>Yokohama Ramen Museum</strong></a>, ramen originated in China and made its way over to Japan in 1859. Early versions were wheat noodles in broth topped with Chinese-style roast pork.

  Etymology
  </h2> 
  
    <p>
    The word ramen is a Japanese transcription of the Chinese lamian. In 1910, a Chinese restaurant serving ramen in Yokohama's Chinatown received public praise in Japan. Until the 1950s, ramen was called shina soba but today chūka soba or just ramen are more common, as the word shina, meaning China, has acquired a pejorative connotation.

Initial appearance
  </h2> 
  
    <p>
    By 1900, restaurants serving Chinese cuisine from Canton and Shanghai offered a simple ramen dish of noodles (cut rather than hand-pulled), a few toppings, and a broth flavored with salt and pork bones. Many Chinese living in Japan also pulled portable food stalls, selling ramen and gyōza dumplings to workers. By the mid-1900s, these stalls used a type of a musical horn called a charumera, from the Portuguese charamela, to advertise their presence, a practice some vendors still retain via a loudspeaker and a looped recording. By the early Shōwa period, ramen had become a popular dish when eating out.

      According to ramen expert Hiroshi Osaki, the first specialized ramen shop opened in Yokohama in 1910.

  Modern period
</h2>
    <p>
    In 1958, instant noodles were invented by Momofuku Ando, the Taiwanese-Japanese founder and chairman of Nissin Foods. Named the greatest Japanese invention of the 20th century in a Japanese poll, instant ramen allowed anyone to make an approximation of this dish simply by adding boiling water. Beginning in the 1980s, ramen became a Japanese cultural icon and was studied around the world from many perspectives. At the same time, local varieties of ramen were hitting the national market and could even be ordered by their regional names. A ramen museum opened in Yokohama in 1994. Today ramen is arguably one of Japan's most popular foods, with Tokyo alone containing around 5,000 ramen shops, and more than 24,000 ramen shops across Japan. Tsuta, a ramen restaurant in Tokyo’s Sugamo district, received a Michelin star in December 2015.
