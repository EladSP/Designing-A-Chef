	<h3>Types of Ramen</h3>
	<p>
		A wide variety of ramen exists in Japan, with geographical and vendor 			specific differences even in varieties that share the same name. Ramen can 		be broadly categorized by its two main ingredients: noodles and broth.
	</p>
	
	
	<h4>
		Noodles
	</h4>

	<p class= "type">
		Most noodles are made from four basic ingredients: wheat flour, salt, 			water, and kansui, a type of alkaline mineral water, containing sodium 			carbonate and usually potassium carbonate, as well as sometimes a small 		amount of phosphoric acid.</p>
		
	<p class= "type">
		The kansui is the distinguishing ingredient in ramen noodles, and 			originated in Inner Mongolia, where some lakes contained large amounts of 		these minerals and whose water is said to be perfect for making these 			noodles. Making noodles with kansui lends them a yellowish hue as well as 		a firm texture. Eggs may also be substituted for kansui. Some noodles are 		made with neither eggs nor kansui and should only be used for yakisoba, as 		they have a weaker structure and are more prone to soaking up moisture and 		becoming extremely soft when served in soup.</p>
	<p class= "type">	
		Ramen comes in various shapes and lengths. It may be thick, thin, or even 		ribbon-like, as well as straight or wrinkled.</p>
	

	<h4>
		Soup
	</h4>
	
	<p class= "type">
		Ramen soup is generally made from stock based on chicken or pork, combined 		with a variety of ingredients such as kombu (kelp), katsuobushi (skipjack 		tuna flakes), niboshi (dried baby sardines), beef bones, pork bones, 			shiitake, and onions. Some modern Ramen broths can also be vegetable 			based.

	<p class= "type">	
		<i>Tonkotsu</i> ("pork bone"; not to be confused with tonkatsu) soup 			usually has a cloudy white colored broth. It is similar to the Chinese 			baitang and has a thick broth made from boiling pork bones, fat, 			and collagen over high heat for many hours, which suffuses the broth with 		a hearty pork flavor and a creamy consistency that rivals milk, melted 			butter or gravy (depending on the shop
	</p>
	
	<h4>
		Flavors
	</h4>

	<p class= "type">
		The resulting combination is generally divided into four categories. 			(although new and original variations often make this categorization less 		clear-cut) Described from old ones.
	<ul>
		<li class= "type"><i>Shōyu</i>("soy sauce") ramen is the oldest of the four, it 		has a clear brown broth, based on a chicken and vegetable (or sometimes fish or 		beef)stock with plenty of soy sauce added resulting in a soup that is tangy, 		salty, and savory yet still fairly light on the palate. <i>Shōyu</i> ramen 		usually has curly noodle rather than straight ones, but this is not always the 		case. It is often adorned with marinated bamboo shoots or <i>menma</i>, green 		onions, <i>kamaboko</i> (fish cakes), <i>nori</i> (seaweed), boiled eggs, bean 		sprouts or black pepper; occasionally the soup will also contain chili oil or 		Chinese spices, and some shops serve sliced beef instead of the usual chāshū.
		</li>
		
		<li class= "type"> <i>Shio</i> ("salt") ramen is a pale, clear, yellowish broth 		made with plenty of salt and any combination of chicken, vegetables, fish, and 		seaweed. Occasionally pork bones are also used, but they are not boiled as long 		as they are for <i>tonkotsu</i> ramen, so the soup remains light and clear. 		<i>Chāshū</i> is sometimes swapped for lean chicken meatballs, and pickled 		plums and <i>kamaboko</i> (a slice of processed fish roll sometimes served as a 		frilly white circle with a pink or red spiral called <i>narutomaki</i>) are 		popular toppings as well. Noodle texture and thickness varies among shio ramen, 		but they are usually straight rather than curly.</li>

		<li class= "type"><i>Miso</i> ramen is a relative newcomer, having reached 		national prominence around 1965. This uniquely Japanese ramen, which was 		developed in Hokkaido, features a broth that combines copious miso and is 		blended with oily chicken or fish broth – and sometimes with <i>tonkotsu</i> or 		lard – to create a thick, nutty, slightly sweet and very hearty soup. Miso 		ramen broth tends to have a robust, tangy flavor, so it stands up to a variety 		of flavorful toppings: spicy bean paste or <i>tōbanjan,</i> butter and corn, 		leeks, onions, bean sprouts, ground pork, cabbage, sesame seeds, white pepper, 		and chopped garlic are common. The noodles are typically thick, curly, and 		slightly chewy.</li>

		<li class= "type"> <i>Curry</i> ramen was first created in 1965 in Hokkaido. 		The soup is mainly made with pork bones and vegetables and is seasoned with 		curry. The noodles are thick and curly. Toppings include chāshū, <i>wakame,</i> 		and bean sprouts. It is a specialty of Hokkaido, particularly Muroran-city 		(hence sometimes being called "Muroran curry ramen").</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4>
		Toppings
	</h4>
	
	<p class= "type">
		After basic preparation, ramen can be seasoned and flavored with any number of 		toppings, including but not limited to:
	</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li class= "topping">Chāshū (sliced barbecued or braised pork)</li>
		<li class= "topping">Scallions (spring onions)</li>
		<li class= "topping">Seasoned (usually salted) boiled egg</li>
		<li class= "topping">Bean or other sprouts</li>
		<li class= "topping">Menma (lactate-fermented bamboo shoots)</li>
		<li class= "topping">Kakuni (braised pork cubes or squares)</li>
		<li class= "topping">Nori (dried seaweed)</li>
		<li class= "topping">Narutomaki/kamaboko (formed fish paste)</li>
		<li class= "topping">Corn</li>
		<li class= "topping">Butter</li>
		<li class= "topping">Wakame</li>
		<li class= "topping">Crispy duck</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>	
		Preference
	</h4>

	<p class= "type">
		Seasonings commonly added to ramen are white pepper, black pepper, butter, 		chili pepper, sesame seeds, and crushed garlic. Soup recipes and methods of 		preparation tend to be closely guarded secrets.

		<p class= "type"> Most <i>tonkotsu</i> ramen restaurants offer a system known 		as <i>kae-dama,</i> where customers who have finished their noodles can request 		a "refill" (for a few hundred yen more) to be put into their remaining soup.
