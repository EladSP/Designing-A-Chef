<body>

Ramen, a Japanese dish. It consists of Chinese-style wheat noodles served in a meat or (occasionally) fish-based broth, often flavored with soy sauce or miso, and uses toppings such as sliced pork, dried seaweed, <i>menma</i> and green onions. Nearly every region in Japan has its own variation of ramen, such as the <i>tonkotsu</i> (pork bone broth) ramen of <em>Kyushu</em> and the miso ramen of <em>Hokkaido</em>.

History
Origin

Ramen is a Japanese adaptation of Chinese wheat noodles. Ramen was first introduced to Japan by Chinese immigrants in the late 19th or early 20th century. According to the record of the new <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin-Yokohama_Rāmen_Museum"><strong>Yokohama Ramen Museum</strong></a>, ramen originated in China and made its way over to Japan in 1859. Early versions were wheat noodles in broth topped with Chinese-style roast pork.

Etymology
The word ramen is a Japanese transcription of the Chinese lamian. In 1910, a Chinese restaurant serving ramen in Yokohama's Chinatown received public praise in Japan. Until the 1950s, ramen was called shina soba but today chūka soba or just ramen are more common, as the word shina, meaning China, has acquired a pejorative connotation.

Initial appearance
By 1900, restaurants serving Chinese cuisine from Canton and Shanghai offered a simple ramen dish of noodles (cut rather than hand-pulled), a few toppings, and a broth flavored with salt and pork bones. Many Chinese living in Japan also pulled portable food stalls, selling ramen and gyōza dumplings to workers. By the mid-1900s, these stalls used a type of a musical horn called a charumera, from the Portuguese charamela, to advertise their presence, a practice some vendors still retain via a loudspeaker and a looped recording. By the early Shōwa period, ramen had become a popular dish when eating out.

According to ramen expert Hiroshi Osaki, the first specialized ramen shop opened in Yokohama in 1910.
